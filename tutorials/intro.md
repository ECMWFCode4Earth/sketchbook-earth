# Sketchbook Earth: Illustrated Climate Chronicles
![Project logo](img/logo_full.png "Sketchbook Earth logo")

Sketchbook Earth is a project aiming to illustrate the production of [Climate Intelligence Reports](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-intelligence), 
traditionally done with the ECMWF's in-house developed tools. In this project we developed a series of Jupyter notebooks that will illustrate our planet's climate stories in an accessible and engaging manner.

Leveraging open-access software and specialized libraries, these notebooks will retrieve and process data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), 
and other sources, transforming raw information into expressive visual narratives. We will focus on downloading and preprocessing Essential Climate 
Variables (ECVs), calculating climate anomalies, and generating visualizations that echo the vibrant storytelling found in a sketchbook. 

The resulting Jupyter notebooks will not only provide meaningful climate insights but also serve as a comprehensive training resource. 
Through Sketchbook Earth, we aim to offer a more visual, comprehensible, and reproducible approach to climate intelligence.

This project was part of the [Code for Climate 2023](https://codeforearth.ecmwf.int/).

### How to Run the Notebooks

You can run the notebooks in three different ways:

1. Binder
2. Google Colab
3. Locally on your machine




The first step for being able to analyse and plot the data is to download and install the necessary libraries for this tutorial. In the GitHub repository you can find the full environment that has all the libraries needed for this and the other tutorials. The environment can be installed in Linux with the simple command: conda env create -f environment.yml. This would be the best option if you use this and the rest tutorials on your local computer. If you are using this tutorial in Google Colab most of the required libraries are already preinstalled in the environment and there are only few libraries that should be downloaded.
